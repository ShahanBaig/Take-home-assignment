1. MongoDB
Chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and seamless integration with JavaScript-based technologies. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB's schema-less nature enables rapid development and easy adaptation to evolving data models.

2. Express.js
Selected for its lightweight and modular structure, making it ideal for building scalable APIs. Its middleware ecosystem simplifies tasks like authentication and request parsing, while its wide adoption ensures robust community support.

3. Node.js
Used as the runtime environment due to its asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model, ensuring high performance and scalability. Its ability to use JavaScript across the stack reduces complexity and accelerates development.

4. Jest
Chosen for its simplicity and speed in testing. With built-in features like mocking, coverage reporting, and snapshot testing, Jest streamlines test writing and ensures reliable API validation.

Instructions
